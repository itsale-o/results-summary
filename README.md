## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

How to use @media on the CSS sheet to make the website responsive for any kind of screen resolution. I did no need it until now, and it was very nice to leran how it works.

### Continued development

For future projects I want to make my front end works totally functional with a bit of JavaScript and more.


### Useful resources

- [Converting Colors](https://www.example.com) - Particullarly I like to call the colors on my CSS code by its HEX code (not always the best choice though). This website converts the code for you from any format you have to any format you like. By now, it is my favorite.
